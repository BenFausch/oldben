                    <p> In For the Love of Rivers, Kurt Fausch draws readers into an international collaboration among stream ecologists to discover the strong hidden connections between rivers and their surrounding forests.
<br>
But the tragic loss of one of his closest Japanese colleagues, and the decline of rivers and fishes that Fausch and his colleagues study, forced him to look beyond the water’s surface and ask what is essential about rivers, and why humans would want to conserve them.
<br>
Fausch states, “Like trees and music and good health, streams and rivers are a gift to us as humans… In the end, I believe we will need to understand how and why we love rivers, if we hope to conserve them.”   </p>

                    <p>A growing number of people are beginning to see things in a radically different way. In other words, more and more of us are starting to "wake up" spiritually—to discover an entirely new identity beyond the usual sense of who we think we are.<br>
But what is spiritual awakening, really? How does it happen—and what are the consequences? Is it possible to attune to this dimension of experience at any moment?<br>
In Waking Up, Sounds True publisher and founder Tami Simon speaks with over 30 of today’s leading authors and teachers who will share their personal understanding of spiritual awakening—how it takes place, what changes (and what doesn't), and how their experiences can inspire and inform our own realization. </p>

                    <p>We cherish the important relationships in our lives. But when so many of us have experienced these relationships as a source of insecurity, hurt, and betrayal, how do we overcome the obstacles between us and cultivate genuine bonds of trust, understanding, intimacy, and love?
<br>
Nourishing Loving Relationships brings you a two-day intensive workshop with Dr. Tara Brach in Tucson, Arizona. Through talks, experiential reflections and meditations, journaling, and periods of questions and sharing, we will explore the beliefs and feelings that separate us—and how to heal and nourish the loving relationships we all long for.
